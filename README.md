# Project Odin Flight Booker

This is [an exercise](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/building-advanced-forms)
in building forms as part of the Odin Project. 

The final show booking is not implemented. This is a non-trivial task as you are
not rendering a single booking, but rather all bookings from the latest 
transaction.
